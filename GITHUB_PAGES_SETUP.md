# 🌐 GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## ✅ Current Status
Your repository is ready for GitHub Pages deployment! Here's what's already configured:

- ✅ Repository: https://github.com/Tarun2231/Iphone_service-Oct17
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- ✅ Production build: `npm run build` creates `/dist` folder
- ✅ Main branch: Contains all code and deployment workflow

## 🚀 Step-by-Step GitHub Pages Setup

### Method 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/Tarun2231/Iphone_service-Oct17

2. **Navigate to Settings**:
   - Click on the "Settings" tab (top right of repository)

3. **Find Pages Section**:
   - Scroll down in the left sidebar
   - Click on "Pages"

4. **Configure Source**:
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
   - This will use our custom workflow for deployment

5. **Save Settings**:
   - Click "Save" if prompted

### Method 2: Using GitHub CLI (Alternative)

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can run:
```bash
gh api repos/Tarun2231/Iphone_service-Oct17/pages --method POST --field source='{"branch":"gh-pages","path":"/"}'
```

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Automatic Deployment**: Every push to `main` branch triggers deployment
2. **GitHub Actions**: Builds your React app using Vite
3. **Deploy**: Publishes the built files to GitHub Pages
4. **Live URL**: https://tarun2231.github.io/Iphone_service-Oct17/

## 📋 Verification Steps

After enabling GitHub Pages:

1. **Check Actions Tab**:
   - Go to "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - It should show as "running" or "completed"

2. **Wait for Deployment**:
   - First deployment may take 5-10 minutes
   - Subsequent deployments are faster

3. **Access Your Site**:
   - Visit: https://tarun2231.github.io/Iphone_service-Oct17/
   - Your Phone Service Pro app should be live!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Ensure the workflow file is correct
3. Verify Node.js version compatibility

### If site doesn't load:
1. Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation
2. Check if the `gh-pages` branch was created
3. Verify the Pages settings in repository settings
