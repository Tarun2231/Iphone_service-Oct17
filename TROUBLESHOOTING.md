# üîß **GitHub Pages Not Working - Troubleshooting Guide**

## üö® **Common Reasons Why Your Link Isn't Opening**

**Solution**:
1. Go to: https://github.com/Tarun2231/Iphone_service-Oct17

3. Scroll down and click "Pages" in left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions" (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
5. Click "Save" if prompted

### **2. Deployment Still in Progress**
**Problem**: The GitHub Actions workflow is still running.

**How to Check**:
1. Go to "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow

### **3. Deployment Failed**
